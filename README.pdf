Analyzing CIA Factbook Data with SQL
by Nicholas Archambault


The goal of this project is to explore basic techniques in SQL through analysis of the CIA Factbook, a compendium of data on every country in the world. 

Expected results include an understanding, by rough metrics, of densely populated nations: those in with below average areas and above average population totals.

The CIA Factbook can be found here: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/
